                        <h3>The Discovery.</h3>
                        <p>Like many sciences, chemistry can be traced back to philosophical origin. Democritus was an early Greek philosopher who was among the first to suggest the existence of atoms. Expanding on his teacher's, Leucippus', doctrines, Democritus proposed a division of reality into two existences: the "Void" and "atoms." The "Void," he explained, was a vacuum of infinite space in which an infinite number of atoms moved.</p>
                        <p>Democritus described atoms as small units that could not be divided further. These tiny particles that are now called "atoms" were named after the Greek word "atomos" which means "indivisible." Democritus described these atoms as incompressible, filling the space they occupy without any gaps. He asserted that they differ only in shape, arrangement, position, and size. These differences would have explained the different appearances and properties of materials. According to Democritus, the original motion of atoms, at the universe's origin, was endless vibration. This vibration led to collisions that allowed similar atoms to be brought together to form larger, observable, objects.</p>
                        <p>Of course, Democritus' findings were founded on abstract thoughts and were not based on experimental evidence. Yet remarkably, this early philosophical approach did agree with some later scientific theory. Even after two thousand years of the game "telephone," Democritus is credited as the first to conceptualize atoms.</p>

                        <p>Democritus' model, the first of its kind to be known, depicts "atoms" as the smallest particle in existence. Democritus is known to have said, "Nothing exists except atoms and empty space [the Void]; everything else is opinion." His model of the atom depicts atoms differing in arrangement, position, shape, and size. These differences, he believed, were the explanation behind the vast variety of materials and their properties.</p>

                        <h3>The Discovery.</h3>
                        <p>The modern history of atomic theory can now be traced back to John Dalton, an English chemist and schoolteacher. This was, of course, a hefty 2000 years after Democritus, due in part to Aristotle's refuting of Democritus' theory.</p>
                        <p>Dalton concluded that evaporated water exists in the air as an independent gas, but wondered how water and air could occupy the same space at the same time, as solid bodies couldn't. He then carried out experiments on the physical mixing and chemical combinations of gases, which led him to propose his modern theory of the atom in 1803. The theory was based off the following parts:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Everything is comprised of tiny indivisible particles called atoms.</li>
                            <li>Atoms of the same element are identical, while atoms of different elements are different.</li>
                            <li>Atoms of elements can be physically mixed together or can be chemically combined in integer ratios to form compounds.</li>
                            <li>Chemical reactions can join, separate, or change the arrangement of an assortment of atoms. The atoms themselves retain their identity throughout this reaction.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Along with this set of theories, John Dalton proposed a model of the atom. Different from Democritus' atomic model, Dalton's model is always round and thus does not vary in shape. Dalton also had a more solid theory in regards to chemical reactions and physical mixings of different substances. Although these ideas, as pioneered by John Dalton, have been further developed and changed throughout the years, much of these original theories are still accepted today.</p>

                        <p>In 1897, English physicist J. J. Thomson discovered the first subatomic particle, the electron, through his experiments with a cathode-ray tube.</p>
                        <p>A cathode-ray tube is a glass tube with metal disks fixed at each end. The gas within the glass tube is kept at very low pressure and the disks are connected to a source of electricity. A glowing beam, called a "cathode-ray," then forms between the two electrodes. J. J. Thomson had placed a positively charged plate and a negatively charged plate outside the glass, hoping to determine the charge of the cathode-ray. He found that the ray was attracted to the positively charged plate and was repelled by the negatively charged one, leading him to conclude that the cathode-ray was indeed comprised of negatively charged particles.</p>
                        <p>Thomson followed up the experiment by changing the materials used for the cathode-ray tube, but it resulted in no change to the cathode-ray itself. Based on this, he determined that the negatively charged particles within the cathode-ray were universal to atoms of all elements.</p>

                        </div>
                        <h3>The Discovery.</h3>
                        <p>Through his famous 1911 gold-foil experiment, Ernest Rutherford, a former student of Thomson, evolved the atomic model once again.</p>
                        <p>Rutherford and his colleagues fired alpha particles, helium atoms that had lost their two electrons, at a thin piece of gold foil (only 0.00004 cm in width). They used a screen coated with zinc sulfide to "catch" the alpha particles after they had penetrated the gold foil. The screen would also emit a flash of light where it was hit by an alpha particle, which enabled them to measure to what extent the gold foil affected the particle's path.</p>
                        <p>Rutherford had predicted the alpha particles would all be able to penetrate the foil, although they would be scattered slightly by collisions with the foil's atoms. The experiment, however, revealed that around 1/20000 of the particles were deflected at angles larger than 90°. In Rutherford's own words, the finding was, "almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you."</p>
                        <p>After some calculations, Rutherford concluded that all the positive charge and virtually all the mass of the atom are concentrated in the "nucleus," which occupies 1/10000th of the radius of the atom. This accounted for the vast majority of alpha particles that were not deflected at all, while also accounting for the small amount that were slightly deflected (due to the force of repulsion between the two positively charged nuclei), and the even smaller amount that were deflected at over 90° (due to the two nuclei colliding).</p>

                            <p>Rutherford's model, according to classical physics, should have electrons constantly emitting electromagnetic radiation (photons). The resulting energy loss should mean the electron spirals into the nucleus after a very short amount of time, meaning atoms can't exist.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h3>The Discovery.</h3>
                        <p>Also a former student of J. J. Thomson, Bohr shook up the world of the atomic model once more. In 1913, shortly after Rutherford and his collaborators established that the atom consists of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus, and electrons orbiting around it, Bohr first contributed to the emerging new idea of quantum physics.</p>
                        <p>Rutherford's atomic model was not perfect and Bohr knew this. For example, according to classical physics, Rutherford's model would be unstable. The electrons orbiting the nucleus should lose energy until they spiral down into the center, thus collapsing the atom. In developing a new model, Bohr considered evidence from the simplest atom, hydrogen, which has one electron.</p>
                        <p>Bohr applied the idea of quanta, developed by Max Planck in 1901, to the model of the atom. This meant that the electron of a hydrogen atom orbits the nucleus in a circular route, which would defy classical physics. He decided to proceed with the assumption that some principles of classical physics may not be consistent on the atomic scale. In Bohr's application, the electron exists at fixed energy levels. An electron could be moved up an energy level by absorbing a "quantum" of energy, but the atom would later discharge light when the electron falls down to a lower energy level. Bohr's theory successfully explained the spectrum of the hydrogen atom, but failed in many ways to explain the properties of atoms with more than one electron.</p>

                        <p>By 1926, new theoretical calculations of the electron's orbit of the nucleus were inconsistent with Niels Bohr's previous description, which had electrons orbiting the nucleus like a large moving object might.</p>
                        <p>Schr&ouml;dinger combined equations for the behaviors of waves and the de Broglie equation to come up with a mathematical model describing electron locations within an atom. The quantum mechanical model, the most modern atomic model, comes from his solution to this equation.</p>
                        <p>Like the Bohr model, the Schrödinger, quantum mechanical, model, involved distinct energy levels of electrons. A very notable difference, however, is that the Schrödinger model defines the electron as a wave, attempting to describe regions where an electron is likely to be found. This, therefore, describes where an electron might be, rather than where it is.</p>
                        <p>The equation reveals the specific energy levels an electron can have. At each of these energy levels, the equation also leads to a mathematical expression that describes the regions in space where finding an electron is highly probable.</p>

                        <h3>The Model.</h3>
                        <p>Schrödinger's work lead to the development of the electron cloud model, which describes the location of electrons not definitively, but instead using probability. In denser regions of the cloud, closer to the nucleus, there is a higher probability of finding an electron. The model also incorporates energy levels, their corresponding energy sublevels, and, in turn, each sublevel's corresponding electron orbitals.</p>
